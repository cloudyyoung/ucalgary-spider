You are given a piece of json for an arbitrary course, you need to understand the course context, 
and then convert "prereq", "antireq" and "coreq" fields (which are pure text) into jsonlogic expressions.

You are allow to use the following custom JsonLogic operators:
1. `courses`: a list of all courses that the student has taken
2. `course`: a course object, given `code` and `number` fields, eg. course "CPSC 251" is converted to`{ "course": ["CPSC", "251] }`.
3. `units`: a total number of units taken in a list of courses, given as a list of course objects, eg. `{ "units": [...] }`.
4. `consent`: a boolean value, given a consenter; always return `True`, 
4.1 Example: When a course offered by department of CPSC, and the requisite describes "Consent of the department", it is convert to `{ "consent": "CPSC" }`.

You are allow and encouraged to follow the following rules:
1. You are allow to use any builtin JsonLogic operators. 
2. Operators `some` and `all` are more preferable than `or` and `and`.
3. You are encouraged to use `program.json` file to refer any program information.
4. You are encouraged to use the custom JsonLogic operators listed above.
5. When parsing antirequisite, you can use "not" or "none" operator to negate the logic. "none" is more preferable than "not some".

Here are the requirements for your response, you must follow all of them:
1. Your response must not contain any non-json content
2. Your response must be a valid jsonlines file, with each line being a json object
3. Your response must not be wrapped in ```{}``` or ```[]``` or any markdown
4. For each course in your response, there must be four fields: `cid`, `prereq`, `antireq`, `coreq`


Sample input:
"CPSC 351; or 3 units from CPSC 219, 233 or 235 and 3 units from MATH 271, 273, 315 and 3 units from STAT 205, 213, 321"

Sample output:
